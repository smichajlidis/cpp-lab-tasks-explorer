# C++ Lab Tasks Explorer

Well, the task was straightforward: to pass C++1 in my studies, I had to write some simple programs. It was a bit boring, so I decided to create a menu with each task, just for fun. And there it is: I present my completed C++1 course tasks solutions. Nothing huge, just a simple OOP program.

## Tasks

The program includes seven tasks:

- **Array Addition**: First, specify how many additions you want to perform. Then, create two arrays with numbers. Finally, view the results of adding those numbers. As simple as pie.

- **Cezar Cipher**: Encrypt and decrypt a given string in the Caesar cipher style.

- **Days Difference**: The program calculates the difference between two given dates.

- **Fibonacci Generator**: A classic problem to solve. How many Fibonacci numbers do you want to generate? Input a number, and the program will display it. Furthermore, there are two Fibonacci programs: one iterative and the second one recursive. Of course, the results are the same.

- **Matrix Multiplier**: Probably the most complicated task so far. Input two matrices and perform multiplication between them. The biggest challenge was validations, but it works fine.

- **PESEL Generator**: Provide your date of birth, and the program will generate a typical Polish identification number for you.

- **Recursively Sum**: Simply sum the numbers from 1 to 100 recursively.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
